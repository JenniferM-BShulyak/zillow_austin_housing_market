### Project Background and Data
________________________________________


### Data
________________________________________
Datasets were downloaded from https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ as CSVs
The following datasets were used: 
>1. ZHVI (zestimate) for single family homes in the mid-tier (35th - 65th percentile) 
>2. ZORI (home and apartment rental price) in the mid-tier (40th-60th percentile)  

More information about zillow: 
  * Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI): A measure of the typical home value and market changes across a given region and housing type. It reflects the typical value for homes in the 35th to 65th percentile range. Available as a smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure and as a raw measure.
  * Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI): A smoothed measure of the typical observed market rate rent across a given region. ZORI is a repeat-rent index that is weighted to the rental housing stock to ensure representativeness across the entire market, not just those homes currently listed for-rent. The index is dollar-denominated by computing the mean of listed rents that fall into the 40th to 60th percentile range for all homes and apartments in a given region, which is once again weighted to reflect the rental housing stock.
